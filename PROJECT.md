# Apex

Android app for syncing health data (blood pressure, body measurements, sleep, workouts)
from Android Health Connect to the Health Platform Desktop server.

Previously lived at `health-platform/android-app/`. Separated 2026-02-26 into its own
standalone repository for clearer AI assistant context and independent versioning.

<!-- QUICK-RESUME-UPDATED: 2026-02-28 -->
## Quick Resume
**Last Active:** 2026-02-28
**Current Phase:** Full LLM audit pipeline complete — all 7 action items executed
**Current Task:** Done. All audit fixes committed (commits e5660a6 → 12b2534). CI running.
**Audit Score:** 3.8/10 → projected 6.0/10 after all fixes (Security 2.4→7.0, Testing 1.0→3.0, Perf 5.3→6.5)
**Blockers:** None. BP/sleep/body tables still empty on server. New HC syncs will populate going forward.
**Next Action:** CI green check. Then consider: expand test coverage (HealthConnectReader, SecurePrefs), add Hilt DI to improve architecture score, README minSdk fix (low priority).

## Commits This Session (2026-02-27)
- `82197aa` — feat: new Apex icon — steel blue gradient + mountain-A lettermark
- `b0126fd` — feat: comprehensive UI polish — steel blue palette, backdrop watermark, haptics, nav transitions

## UI Overhaul Summary (b0126fd)
- **Color system**: Teal → steel blue (#5B9BD5 primary). New ApexSleepLight (#3A5A80) token.
- **Backdrop watermark**: `ApexWatermarkCanvas` draws chevron-A at 5% opacity. Box wraps all Scaffolds (transparent).
- **Haptics**: `HapticManager` + `rememberApexHaptic()`. tick() on tabs/switches, click() on buttons, confirm() on sync, reject() on errors. VibrationEffect.Composition for sync complete/error.
- **Nav transitions**: 200ms fade-in / 150ms fade-out between all NavHost destinations.
- **TrendsScreen**: `AnimatedContent` crossfade between BP/Sleep/Body tabs. Shimmer skeleton replaces loading spinner.
- **minSdk**: 28 → 34 (enables all VibrationEffect.Composition primitives).
- **Bug fix**: `Text("Save API Key", color = ApexBackground)` → `color = ApexOnPrimary` (was invisible white text on white bg).

## What Was Fixed
- **SyncWorker**: API key was empty string `""` — all syncs were 401. Now reads from SharedPrefs.
- **StackedBarChart**: Light sleep bars were invisible (same color as card bg). Fixed.
- **LineChart**: Hardcoded tooltip color replaced with theme token.
- **TrendsScreen**: Removed Activity stub tab. Now BP/Sleep/Body only.
- **All screens**: `padding(top = 56.dp)` → `statusBarsPadding().padding(top = 16.dp)` (edge-to-edge).
- **SettingsScreen**: Lock App Now now actually locks (calls `onLock()`). Server ping on IO dispatcher.
- **AndroidManifest**: Removed 5 unused Health Connect permissions.
- **Error messages**: Raw exceptions (`"Read timed out"`) → `"Server unreachable — check your connection"`.
- **Build**: CI (GitHub Actions JDK 17). APK installed via `adb`. SharedPrefs (API key) preserved across reinstalls.
